This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions. The `Dimensions.get('window')` method may return `undefined` or an object with `width` and `height` as 0, especially during the initial render or when dealing with rapid orientation changes. This can lead to unexpected behavior, layout issues, or crashes if not handled correctly.  For example:

```javascript
const {width, height} = Dimensions.get('window');

//Using width and height directly can result in an error if they are undefined or zero
<View style={{width: width, height: height}} />
```
